## ASSIGNMENT I : Principles of Analysis of Algorithms and Sorting Methods 
Semester II 2022/2023
# Objectives 
• Manipulate data structures or algorithms in problem solving and 
programming.
• Perform complexity analysis of algorithms.
# Specification 
1. Convert the radix sort algorithm that is described in the Appendix section 
to Java program. Note: You must implement exactly like what is 
described. (40%)
2. Modify the radix sort algorithm to sort floating point number. The program 
must be a modification, and not a different implementation or variant of 
radix sort. (30%)
3. Perform complexity analysis on both the algorithms by experiments. Plot 
a graph: number of operation vs n. Determine the big-O for both 
algorithms. (30%)

This assignment is to be carried out in a group of 3 (maximum).
References taken from any sources must be quoted and declared. No 
sharing of answers with other groups. Penalty for late submission, no 
excuse for late submission will be accepted.
. Program and report submission deadline: Sunday, 14/5/2023 11.59
pm.
. Only one of the group leader has to submit the work.
. Report to me if there is any group member that didn’t do their 
work.
